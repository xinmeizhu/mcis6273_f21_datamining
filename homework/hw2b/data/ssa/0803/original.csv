"Iron Asylum Gym is proud to offer our lifters photos of all sizes, and even mugs, puzzles and other items. We have hooked up with Shutterfly to make this more convenient for you, and to offer you a wider variety of products. Sarah will still be receiving any proceeds from these orders, as she is the one that does the work. Thanks for supporting her. She really does a great job of capturing everyone's lifts.",,,,
