"Huge thanks to all who participated on this blistering August day. It was great to see the usual August lifters, along",,,,
with a few new faces. It was really awesome to see Trevor redeem himself. It is so awesome to see a father/son,,,,
team on the platform. Rheta's intensity in the pull made us all about wet ourselves. Mike Montano and Vinnie,,,,
Vardine gave us an awesome Masters show in the bench. Frank is sneaking up on 405 one pr at a time.,,,,
