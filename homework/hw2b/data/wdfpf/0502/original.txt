Report from Neil Thomas
The venue for this year’s world single lift was the excellent facility in Witney, the Windrush Leisure
Centre. Before we talk about the lifting I would like to thank all the members of staff from the
centre for all their help over the 3 days, without whom the event would not of been the success it
was.
Equipment was purchased specially for the competition from FORZA Strength Systems – money
well spent according to all of the lifters over the 3 days. Richard Hossack from FORZA attended the
event over the second and third days and was very impressed with the event so much so he actually
commented that it was probably the best event he had seen and would like to be more involved wit
the BDFPA if this was the standard of events it ran. Many thanks to Richard for providing T-Shirts
for the loading crews at the competition.
Judy Gedney has been in touch with me prior to completing this report to tell me that there were 99
World Records broken at the event, a testament to the standard of the lifting over the 3 days from
the 227 entries – not including endurance.
Squat Day 1
As par for the course on any single lift competition the squat day produced 36 entries from 9
different countries. Beny Verbeke, TJ Meehan and Mark Haydock started the competition as they
meant to go on all setting world records in their classes. The Friday was actually attended by a lot of
the local press; the Oxford Mail/Star was there along with a news team from BBC South Today to
cover the event. Judy became a bit of a darling of the press by appearing on TV that night and many
of the newspaper articles in the following days. The coverage by the press did exactly what we are
trying to achieve in the sport – show that it is for every one!
Best Lifters:
Judy Gedney/Dean Mikosz – Equipped
Judy Gedney/Mark Haydock – Un-Equipped
Bench Day 2
This was the day of days 140 entries and the trial of the double platform. Despite a small issue at the
beginning of the day with some late entries the event started at 11.30. The platform arrangement
worked fantastically and 15 flights of bench were completed in less than 4 hours!!!!!
Many new world and European records set over the second day – well done to Les Pilling and David
Wallis for their records and Martin Green for at last getting his.
The double platform is appoint worth another mention as it was the first time it had been tried in
the UK – as far as I am aware. The system worked almost perfectly the almost coming from the fact
that some lifters kept coming to the table worried they could not find their name on the flights
behind the platform - surely you would check both platforms before asking!!!!!
That aside I was surprised myself that the 2 platforms did not create problems for each other in
terms of announcements or space. This is without a doubt the way forward for events of this scale.
It would appear we may have found the solution to the long days even at British Nationals.
Best Lifters:
Cecile Reynes/John Dolan – Un-Equipped
Judy Gedney/Dave Fitzhenry – Equipped
Endurance
This had 28 competitors and took almost as long as the proper competition did!!
Not a lot to say about this, lot of reps a bit of fun.
Well done however to Maria Teresa De Marzio and Scott McConnell in winning this event.
Deadlift Day 3
Again a double platform day. 51 entries today so with the double platform a very fast finish. The
event started at 10.00 am and all were away by 1.00 pm, so perhaps a standard set.
Some monster lifting in the dead lift with particular mentions to Beny V, Mark H, Lewis Graddon,
Terry Jex and Judy Gedney all setting records. It was very nice to have Paul See – a French lifter –
still plucking out world records at the age of 85!, fair dos to the bloke if you are still going at that age
you deserve them all.

Many thanks required to all of the admin staff that helped out over the 3 days.
Sam, Andrew, Wim, George, Gemma and Steve for helping out to MC and score. Mark Lane for
spending more time in the toilet drugs testing than watching the event!
All the referees from all the countries who helped out. But most of all the military guys who did all
the loading for the 3 days. Nearly 1,000 loads and only 1 miss load – I will take those percentages
anytime. Apologies to those who did not get a t-shirt, I now have some more so get in touch and I
will send them on.

Report from Saul Shocket forwarded from Judy Gedney
Could this particular single event format become a more widely accepted mode of future competition?
Although I don’t expect the single event format to soon, if ever, replace the conventional 3 event power
meet, it certainly is more crowd friendly in regard to meet length. Additionally it allows the injured athlete
or single lift specialist the opportunity to pick & choose their event(s). The WDFPF version of the
Single Event World Championships involves competition in one event per day. Our schedule in Witney,
England was as follows:
Friday’s Schedule Included:, AM - Unequipped Squat, Afternoon – Equipped Squat
Saturday AM – Unequipped Bench Press, Afternoon – Equipped Bench Press, PM – Bench Press
Endurance
Sunday AM – Unequipped Deadlift, Afternoon- Equipped Deadlift
Although some lifters did choose to focus on a particular event, many lifters chose to compete in all
three.
There were a number of inspirational lifts performed during the course of this competition. The beauty
of our sport involves that moment of truth we have all experienced during each max or near max lift we
attempt. In powerlifting, there is almost always that defining moment where we either make the
commitment to succeed with the attempt, or fail to make that commitment. This all happens within a
fraction of time, yet involves a number of personal factors. Serious competitors will know exactly what
I’m talking about. Every competition offers each of us that opportunity & I believe that’s what makes
competition lifting so fulfilling. The 2005 WDFPF Single Event Worlds was again well represented by a
host of 12 countries including: Australia, Belgium, Cyprus, England, France, Ireland, Italy, Russia,
Scotland, Switzerland, Wales, & the USA. This year the grand total of competitors numbered 244. The
team competition was won by England.
Listed below are the number of world records broken/set by each nation.
Australia                    5       England                   25       Italy     3         Switzerland
          5
Belgium            6        France           11       Russia 1         Wales           2
Cyprus             2        Scotland                  0       USA      28      Ireland         11
A total of 99 world records were set during the competition between 244 drug-free athletes.
This was my 4th consecutive Single Event World Championships, the first two being held in Italy
(Capiago & Como), while last years Worlds was held in Antwerp, Belgium. This meet, as the others, was
well planned & executed. The heart & soul of a successful Power Meet directly revolves around the
competency & fairness of the judging & to my view, the judging here was both knowledgeable & fair.
Team USA, represented by the newly re-structured ADFPF, was particularly well received by the
International Community. WDFPF President Andrew Cominos, Vice President Wim Backelant of
Belgium, Meet Director Neil Thomas, & the ADFPF’s indefatigable Judy Gedney did a great job for the
lifters & for drug free sport in general.
The 2005 WDFPF World Powerlifting Championships will be held in Torino, Italy on December 10th &
11th. Torino will be hosting the 2006 Winter Olympic Games 2 months later, so this will be a very
exciting place to be. The 2006 World Single Event Championships will be held in Bendigo, Australia on
October 13th, 14th, & 15th, with the 2006 Powerlifting World Championships being held in Cork,
Ireland November 11th, & 12th. Lifting heavy weights in exciting & exotic places sounds pretty good.
Report from Rasheed Patel on the West Midlands achievements
The W.D.F.P.F held their world single lift championships for 2005 over three days in Witney, Oxford
from Friday 14th October. This annual championship was scheduled for November in Croatia but
due to late cancellation was hosted by the British federation who out voted the proposed bid by the
city of Chicago, U.S.A.
This is one of two world championships held by the W.D.F.P.F each year, the meet attracts lifters
from as far as Australia to America, with male and female competitors as young as 14yrs to late 80s.
The competition involves the normal three lifts of powerlifting - the squat, the bench press and the
deadlift. The difference is each lifts are treated as an individual event, so competitors can become a
world champion in whatever event they are invited to compete in. The traditional powerlifting
competition is the other event held by W.D.F.P.F each year and is scheduled for December in Turin,
Italy for 2005.
To qualify for either of the two world championships, a competitor would have to be selected to
represent England by invitation only from the British secretary. Usually this involves the competitor
winning his / her age-weight class group from his divisional region i.e. Gloucester (West Midlands)
championships, then qualifying and winning in the British finals. Normally the top three lifters in
each class would be selected to represent England.
Three Barton & Tredworth locals competed in Oxford of which the youngest was Hussain Patel
aged 15. Hussain currently holds two world records the squat and deadlift in the U16 60kg class and
two British titles and several British records. This was Hussain’s first world championships this time
he competed in the slightly heavier class of 67.5kg, with a successful second day Hussain won the
world title in the bench press which is his weaker event. On day three he lifted in his best event the
deadlift and set a new world record with a impressive lift of 145kg at the bodyweight of 62kg.
Also competing was Hussain’s father Rasheed (aka Ross) Patel in the Masters 1 category over 40s,
weighing in at 80kg. Rasheed is the West Midlands divisional representative for the British Drug Free
Powerlifting Association, and has set seven new British records in just over two years and was down
to compete in four events, unfortunately he was nursing a cold and a old shoulder injury on the day
of the competition. Rasheed still managed to retain his two world titles and defeat his Russian
opponents in the bench press.
The third lifter Gedimious Mockevicious from Tredworth, competed for his native country of
Lithuania. In the 90kg open class it was Ged’s only second competition and is a new comer to this
sport, he was lifting in two events. Ged was up against the wall from the start; having the world
champion in his class, unfortunately due to technical faults he did not get a good lift on the board. In
the next event the bench press endurance, which is fairly new to this sport he came up trumps and
clinched his first world title.
The next West Midlands divisional single lift championships will be held in Birmingham on the 26th
November 2005
