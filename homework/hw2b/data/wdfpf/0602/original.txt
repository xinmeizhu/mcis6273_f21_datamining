Report from Mark Norton
The 2006 European Championships were held in the town of Maromme, northern France. The
venue was a purpose built sports centre, Stade Paul Vauquelin just outside the town centre. Food and
drink were in plentiful supply to keep hunger at bay.
On to the competition, in the 44kg class Pat Reeves took the title after an epic journey through
France and our only female entrant. In the 67.5kg class, two from the T3 age group lifted very well
in a close battle Gordon Rennie, Scotland, just 5kg ahead of Baljit Cheema, England who later on
went to celebrate by drinking all the local cider at the venue. David Wilson was injured and put a
total of 395kg in and gained team points. In the 75kg class another young Scot, John Paul Hayes
managed a 405kg total for 2nd place behind a useful French T3 lifter. Laurie Constantin put a 465kg
total together for the M1 title
In the 82.5 kg class, Laurence Bradshaw at T1 (14 years old) put together a solid 452.5kg total which
included a few records. Jonathan Biggin in the T2 age group put in an excellent 485kg including a
215kg deadlift to take the title.
Unfortunately no 90kg lifters but 3 in the 100’s, Jules Vowles and Stephen Fisher locked horns again
after their British encounter and Jules took the honour by virtue of a better deadlift this time
narrowly missing a big 300kg deadlift. Alastair Christie at M4 totalled 550kg which included a 240kg
deadlift and another Scottish win. It was also good to see the Swiss at an International event, I spoke
to Markus Reiner afterwards and he was delighted with his 9 for 9 PB performance and 3rd place in
the open.
At 110 Les Pilling M3 totalled 680kg to win the open and M3 title and Ronnie Simpson took the M4
honours with 520kg’s for Scotland.
Mark Haydock at 145kg class produced another world class performance. Considering he had driven
the mini bus, along with Eddie Bennett the whole day before 780kg is big.
Day 2 and the equipped section: Stephen Brown started the proceedings in the 60kg weight category,
pulling an impressive 210kg deadlift to end up with 495kg’s.
In the 75’s William Brown, Scotland and Dean Mikosz, England had another close fought contest
with Dean squatting 260kg and benching 155kg giving him a 35kg subtotal over Willie. So it came
down to the deadlift Dean started with 205 and Willie succeeded with 240, Dean went for the win
with 217.5kg but missed it and Willie pulled 245 for a 2nd attempt. Dean then went for 220kg only to
see Willie pull 250kg and 1st place by only 10kg’s, a great contest.
Steve Cook from Wales at 82.5 lifted well for his first international and was in the company of some
well seasoned lifters in Beny Verbeke Belgium and Elie Lalouche of France. Steve totalled 605kg in
the open event. Steve Maden lifted solo in the 90kg class, totalling 625kg, Euro title and maximum
team points.
Matt Saunders 100kg class needs no introduction and went on to total 857.5kg a British and
European record. He also claimed the bench press record with 222.5kg in the process. Matt will be
going for a record 10th World title in November at the Worlds in Ireland.
In the 110’s Les Pilling totalled 765kg at M3 for the umpteenth European title. I managed to break a
long standing record at M1 in the squat with 340.5kg and get a PB total 840kg which I was satisfied
with considering the fact that I had a poorly knee and hip.
Gerald Pilling did the business at 125 with 860kg including a British squat record 330kg and I don’t
think it will be too long before he hits the 900kg mark. Hamish Davidson from Scotland
unfortunately went out on the squats probably due to being a little ill.
Anyway the next stop for most us will be the Worlds in Kinsale, Ireland in November and I wish
everyone the best of luck. I‘m sure the IDFPA will put on a great championships.
