"The World Bench Press & Dead Lift Championships in Antwerp, Belgium, were",,,,
a real tonic for WDFPF supporters at the end of a frustrating year. The event,,,,
"was perhaps the most international in character since 1992, with participation",,,,
from several new affiliates. Ten countries in all were represented - the usual,,,,
"big teams from Belgium, England and France - and minority representation",,,,
"from Russia, Kenya, Scotland and Ireland. Despite problems with our US",,,,
"affiliation, we had 4 lifters making the trip from the USA, who competed to a",,,,
"good standard and were a credit to their country. The newest affiliation,",,,,
"Ecuador, had two lifters, John Constante and a promising Junior, Christian",,,,
Acuna. These were well received on the international platform for the first,,,,
time. Highlight as far as overseas involvement was concerned - a team of no,,,,
"less than 19 lifters from Italy, whose affiliate organization WDFPF Italia did",,,,
themselves proud at this their first international competition and impressed,,,,
"everyone with their appearance, discipline and attitude. It was also my",,,,
"pleasure to welcome Moussa Messaour, President of the Algerian Association,",,,,
who visited the meet minus the eight lifters we had hoped to see due to a,,,,
shortage of time in which to finalize their visas to Belgium. We look forward to,,,,
"seeing the Algerian team in action soon, and results of their nationals will be",,,,
publicized in the near future.,,,,
The youngest competitor at the meet was 15 - the oldest 83! This competition,,,,
"highlighted the nature of the WDFPF as a body of like-minded lifters,",,,,
"dedicated to the same principle, namely the success of drug-free",,,,
powerlifting.,,,,
Best of the women in the Unequipped Bench Press were Tiziana Monteleone,,,,
"(Italy) and Junior lifter Nadia Vittori (France), whilst the best of the lighter men",,,,
"were Harry Reeves (USA) & Mark Kirkland (England), who had a close battle at",,,,
"82.5 with Reeves winning the title by only 2.5 kgs. Not far behind, the Italian",,,,
"lifters Pedercini, Greco and Formato were all very close to the leaders on",,,,
"Schwartz. In the heavier classes, a nail-biting clash between 90kg men Ron",,,,
Madison (USA) and Andy Rigby (England) ended up with a win for Madison by,,,,
202.5 to Rigby's 190. These are international drug-free lifters of the highest,,,,
"calibre, and the close contest between them was appreciated by an",,,,
enthusiastic crowd. Madison also won the trophy for the best Mens',,,,
unequipped bench press of the championship.,,,,
"In the 100s top honours went to Boumeddienne Bensalah, a stylish Algerian",,,,
M2 lifter who is based in France. It is likely that when the affiliation of Algeria is,,,,
"retified in the near future, Bensalah will elect to lift as a member of that team.",,,,
"In the same weight class, Ecuador Junior Christian Acuna impressed with 150",,,,
"kgs. on his international debut, just failing 153 for a world record. Top 110 lifter",,,,
"was Bob Nagle (USA), who made three good lifts to finish with 180 at M1.",,,,
England's Laine Snook has the strength to match his 285 lb (129.6 kg),,,,
"physique. Standing 6'8"" and very muscular, Laine does not have the benefit",,,,
of a 'barrel' chest or stubby arms - but has a long way to push the bar. He,,,,
"made 205 kgs. on this occasion, just failing with 212.5, a weight he has done",,,,
several times before. For a genuine drug-free performer lifting 'raw' - this is,,,,
some going.,,,,
The Equipped Bench Press section saw a close call for the best Womens',,,,
"bench press, between Masters' lifters Dominique Launay and Heidi Taubmann",,,,
"(both from France). Despite being off form, Taubmann won the trophy on the",,,,
Malone formula. She is one of the most impressive drug-free woman,,,,
"benchers in the world, with 91.5 kgs. to her credit at only 55.5 bodyweight. Of",,,,
"the lighter men, most impressive were Italy's Roberto Materri and Vito",,,,
"Carangelo, who dominated the 67.5s and 82.5s respectively. At 51 years of",,,,
"age, Carangelo's Master 3 performance was outstanding.",,,,
A number of lifters topped 100 Schwartz points in the heavier groupings:,,,,
"World record holder John Feehan (Ireland) notched up 242.5 kgs. at 110, just",,,,
failing with a record attempt on 250.5. His was the outstanding equipped,,,,
"bench press of the entire meet. Also in the 110s, Belgian teenager Filip Van",,,,
"Nijlen impressed with 205, whilst at 68 years of age Belgian Master 6 lifter,",,,,
"Gerard Zappa, produced a terrific world record of 153 kgs., just missing 160",,,,
on his third. In the same class Ian Tudor (England) pressed 193 kgs. for a new,,,,
"'equipped' record at Master 3, without a bench shirt - apparently trying to",,,,
prove a point! The big benchers among the heavy men were Collart,,,,
"(Belgium) on 200, Baker and Rowlands (England) on 225 and 227.5",,,,
respectively. Not forgetting the meet promoter Wim Backelant (Belgium) who,,,,
made the biggest lift of the whole competition with 245 kgs. The genial,,,,
"Belgian giant has a training lift of 260 to his credit, probably the biggest-ever",,,,
bench by a drug-free lifter in Europe. Backelant was recently nominated the,,,,
new Vice-President of the WDFPF.,,,,
In the Unequipped Dead Lift honours for the women went to Rose Lozano,,,,
(France) who made 140 kgs. at only 52.5 bodyweight. Mark Quinn (England),,,,
"was narrowly beaten on Schwartz by Pascal Mahourat (France), whose 270",,,,
kgs. at Master 1was the best placed lift of the unequipped competition. At 90,,,,
there was a close contest between Jex (England) and Lane (Ireland). Jex,,,,
"finished on 280 kgs., whilst Lane made 270 and came close with 282.5. In",,,,
the 100s Ecuador's two-man team of John Constante and Christian Acuna,,,,
"pulled out all the stops, with Constante making 250 on his 2nd, and Acuna",,,,
getting three good lifts and a personal best on 225. An injured Corey Ferrel,,,,
"(USA) was nevertheless near the top on Schwartz, though he made only his",,,,
"opener with 295 kgs., failing twice on 320, a lift he has made before. On form",,,,
there are not too many drug-free dead lifters who could come close to him.,,,,
"In the Equipped Dead Lift Maryse Peluhet (France) had a bad day, her wide",,,,
sumo stance giving her problems on a slightly slippery platform. At 58.5 she,,,,
"made her second attempt on 145 kgs., losing 150.",,,,
"At 83 years young, the 'evergreen' Ron Cluer still dead lifts near the 100 kg.",,,,
mark at just over 130 lbs bodyweight. A Master 9 lifter! - Ron was a great,,,,
favourite of the big Italian squad who showed outstanding sportsmanship,,,,
"throughout, giving encouragement to everyone regardless of nationality or",,,,
position in the competition. In the 75s we saw a fine world record of 225 kgs.,,,,
by Teenage 1 lifter Sebastian Bogers (Belgium) - tremendous lifting for a 15,,,,
year old.,,,,
"Among the heavier men, the 'Champion of Champions' trophy for the Dead",,,,
"Lift went to Belgium's Frank Mombert, who made 315 on this occasion, just",,,,
"failing 325. Absent from this competition was Matt Saunders from England,",,,,
who has a 328 to his credit. A match between these two is always one of the,,,,
most eagerly anticipated highlights at WDFPF internationals. Two other top,,,,
English competitors just failed to make big lifts - Dave Allison failing with 305,,,,
"kgs after getting a comfortable opener with 285, and Europe's leading 3-lift",,,,
man Audley Baker just missing the 350 which is currently his main target.,,,,
,,,,
"This was one of the most enjoyable events for a long time, with good lifting,",,,,
great atmosphere and camaraderie - just what the WDFPF is all about.,,,,
