"This event was a lot of fun. It was held at Bartow Fitness Center. Special thanks to Keith Helm for all the work he put into getting the event and a new gym organized in time for the meet. Lifters came from as far as Connecticut to compete in the event and several records were broken. I was especially proud to have my son Russell decide he wanted to compete in this sport. Russell made this his first contest ever and is sold on powerlifting. This will make several generations of lifters in the Taylor family starting with my father who was a competitive olympic lifter and also was a judge when powerlifting was first getting organized as a sport. Since then, I competed, 2 daughters competed in the 90's, and now my boy has entered the sport. Hopefully I will have grandchildren competing as well. Special thanks to the referee's and spotters for doing a great job and once again thanks to Keith Helm for making this event possible.",,,,,,
