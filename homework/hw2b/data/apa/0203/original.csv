"Special thanks to Shelton Harrison for making this meet possible and all the hard work he put into getting things ready. Thanks to Sean Redfern who provided some equipment that was needed and of course thanks to the judges, spotters/loaders who did a great job and kept things going smooth. Unfortunately we lost a few lifters. One team captain ended up in the hospital and several lifters who were going with him stayed behind. One lifter got ill and couldn't lift. Unfortunately, the meet site had to be changed for reasons beyond our control. Then it had to be changed a second time because the building we scheduled with the second time around was shut down. When the meet site was changed a 3rd time I had to send out hundreds of new flyers to APA members and make notification to all who had PRE-REGISTERED as the event had an ENTRY DEADLINE written on the entry form. This was not good enough for one loudmouth who spoke for a group from Salisbury, North Carolina. Rather than calling me a few days early like most people do this guy waited until the day of the meet and called my wife and acted like a total jerk. My wife explained that there was an ENTRY DEADLINE and had he sent in his form we would have known who he was and what his phone number was so we could have told him of the meet site change. This is what meet directors do for others who PRE-REGISTER. Anyway, dumbo didn't get the big picture and started yelling at my wife and claimed he had been competing since 1986 and NEVER PRE-REGISTERED for anybodies meets. When asked if he even had an entry form he said no but claimed one of his buddies (who had not pre-registered) had an entry form. My wife then tried to explain that the meet site had been moved to less than a mile from the original meet site but the jerk slammed the phone in her ear before she could tell him this. Needless to say, entry deadlines are on entry forms for a reason as are the promoters phone numbers. Usually calling the number the day of a meet is a bit too late to be asking questions or finding out about changes. The meet director is usually at the meet and not at home the day of a meet he is running. If you don't pre-register the promoter does not have your phone number on file to notify you of the change. I don't think we were missing anything special with the absence of one loudmouth with an attitude. The meet itself was a lot of fun and some great lifts were registered. Phil Harrington cranked out a nice 447 bench press at bodyweight of 178. Sean Redfern did a 390 bench press at bodyweight of 180. Awesome lifting! Brad Kelly cranked out 550 in the bench press at bodyweight of 235 and missed on two 600 attempts. He has hit 600 before. Guest Lifter John Demchak pulled a 595 deadlift for a state record. John maintains the North Carolina and South Carolina website for the APA and does a great job keeping up with records. John will be running some APA meets soon in North Carolina. The highest total in the full power event was done by Chris Gibson who totaled 1690 at 197 bodyweight. I'd like to congratulate all the lifters. Everybody did a great job and sportsmanship was great. The ladies were awesome. The youngest lifter was 12 year old Kamorean Hayes who competed in the womens open 165 class with a 595 total. Way to go gal!  The oldest lifter was 59 year old Don Blackmon who benched a whopping 470 pounds! Once again, special thanks to Shelton Harrison, Sean Redfern, all of the spotters/loaders and referee's for doing an outstanding job.",,,,,,,,
