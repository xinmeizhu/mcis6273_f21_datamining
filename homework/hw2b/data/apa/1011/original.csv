"A very special thanks to our sponsors which included -Powerlifting USA Magazine, Pete -Alaniz of Titan, Rick Longoria of Vitamin Extreme, Chiropractic Professionals, Tom Brown Middle School, and Rick Brewer of House of Pain. Your sponsorship was much appreciated.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Approximately 50% of the competitors chose to compete raw and some nice raw totals were achieved at this event.  David Hernandez wowed everybody with very impressive raw lifts of 615 squat, 510 bench press, and 575 -deadlift for a raw 1700 total.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Several Youth lifters in the 7-12 year old bracket competed in the Youth event and several teenagers beginning at age 13 participated in the Teenage category. The kids registered some awesome lifts. The highest teenage total was 1900 by 17 year old Preston Turner who registered lifts of 800 squat, 500 bench press, and 600 -deadlift. This kid was awesome!",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"17 year old Olivia Harrington competing in the -Womens Teenage 165 class registered very impressive lifts with a 350 squat, 200 bench press, and 280 -deadlift for a 900 total.  Although she didn’t do the lifts she intended to do, she nether less put in some very impressive lifts.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Another very impressive teenager was 15 year old Cameron Handy who competed raw and had the highest total of all the teenagers in the 181 teenage bracket.  He squatted 435 raw, benched 240 raw, and -deadlifted 450 raw for a 1125 total.  This is a very impressive total for a 15 year old but even more impressive was the fact that he was lifting RAW when he did those lifts!",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"In the 198 class Jerry Saldana put in a very impressive 1770 total with a 670 squat and 700 attempt which was a miss, 500 bench press, and 600 -deadlift.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Cody -Chochado competed in the Master I. 242 class and put in some very impressive lifts at 46 years old. Separating him from the rest of the lifters is the fact that Cody is also blind.  He put in a 550 squat, 410 bench press, and 550 -deadlift for a 1510 total.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Lifting raw in the 220 Master I. category, John Sullivan (age 46) put in some very impressive lifts including a 535 squat, 325 bench press, and 550 -deadlift for a 1410 raw total while Bill Ellis (age 52) competed raw in the Master II. 220 category with very impressive raw lifts including a 475 squat, 325 bench press, 500 -deadlift, for a 1300 raw total.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Some very impressive raw performances were done in the 242 class including Leroy Gutierrez squatting 565, benching 405, -deadlift 560 and totaling 1530 raw, while Enrique Molina (age 49 – Master I.) squatted 470, benched 375, and pulled 500 for a 1345 total. Enrique was closely followed by Tim Sweet (age 45 – Master I.) who made a successful record attempt squat of 510 raw, benched 400, and -deadlifted 440 for a 1280 meet total and 1330 record total giving him the Texas RAW Master record.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"The 242 gear categories were also very impressive with Junior lifter Jorge -Pillado (age 22) squatting 810, benching 585, and -deadlifting 750 RAW for a whopping 2145 total, and 17 year old Preston Turned squatting 800, benching 500, -deadlifting 600, and totaling 1900.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Chris -Pappillion totaled 2125 in the 275’s, with a 855 squat and miss with 900, 600 bench press, and 670 -deadlift and two 725 misses.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"In the 308’s, David Ortiz did a very impressive 865 squat and 565 bench press. He put in a 550 -deadlift but his two missed attempts with 600 kept him from the total he wanted.  He still ended up with a very impressive 1915 total at the end of the day.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Some very, very impressive lifts took place in the Youth Category.  Probably the most impressive form I have seen in the squat and -deadlift ironically came from a 7 year old! -Lanie Dubose was our youngest competitor in the youth class. She was meticulous on setting up to perform her lifts and had the most flawless form I have ever seen throughout a lift. Kudos to her coach for doing an excellent job.  Her training partner and fellow competitor -Jaci Gomez had a different lifting style but also had flawless form start to finish.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Many kids participated in the Youth 7-12 category and they all did a fantastic job.  Considering the ages, these kids put in some incredible lifts.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
All in all it was a great weekend.  Special thanks to Victor -Cadena and Matt Craig for making all of this possible.  Next years event will be even more exciting as the WPA has recently added Russia and Singapore to our umbrella and Russia has already had a WPA Nationals.  I am awaiting results from the WPA Russian Nationals. I understand many impressive lifts were done and am sure I will be very busy with record updates.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Once again,  a big thanks to our sponsors, referee’s, spotters, loaders, MC Paul Barbee and all else who helped make this a very memorable event which was enjoyed by all.",,,,,,,,
