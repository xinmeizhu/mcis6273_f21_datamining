A very special thanks to Chip Conrad and the staff of Body Tribe Fitness of Sacramento for putting on an excellent competition. Several new RAW records were set at this event. Mikel Palmquist took male best lifter honors while Sara Clinkenbeard took the female best lifter award. Her 410 lb. deadlift was amazing!,,,,,,,,,,
