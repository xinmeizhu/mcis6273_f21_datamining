"Special thanks to Chip Conrad, our referee's, spotters/loaders and the Bodytribe Fitness Crew for putting on an outstanding event. Several RAW records",,,,,,,
were set at this event. Stan Efferding was simply unreal. His lifts were performed in superb form and his squats were ultra deep. Stan was planning on an,,,,,,,
800+ squat but passed and settled for 755 after some twitching developed in his leg. He got a 550 bench press and nearly got 580. His 765 deadlift was super,,,,,,,
"fast and smooth and he ended with a 2070 ""RAW"" total.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
"Our female best lifter was Sara Clinkenboard who was competing for the first time ever and ended up with a record total of 930 ""RAW"".",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
10 year old Jonah Cartwright wowed everybody with his outstanding performance at such a young age and light bodyweight while his dad veteran lifter,,,,,,,
Scott Cartwright proudly looked on as his young son set several records. Not only his this young lad quite the lifter he is a very polite and humble child who,,,,,,,
obviously is being raised very well. He has a dad who is spending quality time with him and providing constructive activity and it shows. I wish more parents,,,,,,,
would teach their kids to be so respectful in this day and age. Good job Johan and good job Scott!,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Special Olympian Freddy Boza had plenty of crowd support as he bench pressed 140 pounds at 112 lb bodyweight lifting under standard lifting rules! Way to,,,,,,,
"go Freddy. Needless to say, Freddy shattered several special olympics records.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
"The meet not only went off on time, we started 15 minutes early which was good with the amount of lifters who entered.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
I will be updating the records this week and putting them on the APA website. Special thanks to all the lifters and staff of Bodytribe who made this a very,,,,,,,
memorable occasion and well run event.,,,,,,,
