4 World Records set at APA Billy Funk Memorial Power Lifting Championships,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
It was 1 year ago when Billy Funk was preparing for his first Power Lifting Competition with the American Power Lifting,,,,,,,,
Association or A.P.A. He would never get the chance to compete however. He was tragically killed in a car wreck on,,,,,,,,
"October 31st of 2009, two weeks before his meet. Billy was raised in Portola California so it is only fitting that",,,,,,,,
"Portola’s first ever Power Lifting Competition be held in an out door venue, sanctioned by the APA and named in honor of him.",,,,,,,,
"As only Billy would have it, the A.P.A Billy Funk Memorial “ALL RAW” Power Lifting Championships was a smashing success.",,,,,,,,
"On Saturday October 9th, athletes came from all over California and from as far away as Washington. They were greeted by a",,,,,,,,
large bill board right on highway 70 in Portola where Healthy Bodies Fitness can be found. Behind Healthy Bodies,,,,,,,,
"enthusiastic and friendly spectators nearly filled a 2,400 square foot tent set right off the golf course at the Chalet",,,,,,,,
View Lodge. This is where the action would happen as 4 A.P.A World Records were broken as well as a host of California,,,,,,,,
State Records.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
The Billy Funk Memorial opening ceremonies started with Promoter Brad Loomis giving a touching dedication to his Friend,,,,,,,,
and Training Partner. Father Renier Siva of Holy Family Parrish would say a blessing right before Kelli Prichard and her,,,,,,,,
brother Randy performed a beautiful rendition of our National Anthem. Brad gave a brief description of the rules for Power,,,,,,,,
"Lifting to the spectators present, then it was time for the lifting.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"In this Full Power and Bench Only “Raw” competition, Andrea Murana of Portola had the difficult task of starting the",,,,,,,,
competition in the Squat. Andrea would be successful with a squat of 95lbs in her first ever power lifting competition,,,,,,,,
and a total of 315lbs to take the women’s 123lb masters class.  The highlight of the Squat Competition would come when,,,,,,,,
"Justin Thomsen of Washington would set an APA World Record for 19 year olds in the 220lb weight class. On his final lift,",,,,,,,,
Justin got 3 whites as he would squat 565lbs.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
The Bench Press Competition would test the athlete’s upper body strength. Barbara Lyon would be the pound for pound best,,,,,,,,
in the Women with her bench press of 120lbs. However Gary McFarland of Quincy would be the star of the Bench Pressers.,,,,,,,,
His lift of 420lbs would be a World Record for 45-49 year old men in the 242lb weight class.,,,,,,,,
"The main event was a test of total body strength in the Dead Lift. In his Power Lifting Debut, 7 year old Xander Loomis",,,,,,,,
did an exhibition Dead Lift of 105lbs with near perfect technique. However all eyes were on Portola’s Melissa Klundby as,,,,,,,,
she would attempt to lift nearly 2 ½ times her body weight. Melissa’s Dead Lift of 315lbs would be a Women’s Open World,,,,,,,,
Record in the 132lb weight class.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"The Men’s Open Best Lifter would be Mike Haslanik totaling 1,550lbs while Melissa Klundby would top the Open Women with a",,,,,,,,
"640lbs total. In the Masters Class, all competitors over the age of 35, Crombergs John LaGrill was crowned Men’s best",,,,,,,,
lifter while Portola’s Cindy Wood earned the Women’s Title. However a mighty 4th dead lift of 560lbs would once again put,,,,,,,,
"19 year old Justin Thomsen in the record books for the 220lb weight class. His combined total of 1,415lbs would be the 4th",,,,,,,,
World Record set at the Billy Funk Memorial Power Lifting Championships.,,,,,,,,
