"A very special thanks to LifeQuest Fitness for hosting this event, to those who judged, spotted, loaded, and especially those who",,,,,,,,
helped make this meet possible on last minutes notice.  Another federation had planned a meet in this time frame and canceled at,,,,,,,,
"the last minute, so many lifters were set for a meet in this time frame.  With a couple weeks notice the APA supplied them with",,,,,,,,
a meet and some awesome lifting took place.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Paul Ratsch set a new master record with an 805 lift that went up smoothly.  Paul had a lot more to spare.  Ryan Kennelly opened with,,,,,,,,
"a big 950 bench and it went up without hesitation.  Then he attempted an ""all time"" record of 1050 and put that up even faster!  For",,,,,,,,
a 3rd attempt he tried 1105 and made it to within an inch of lockout.  Obviously he has 1100 in him and we should see that very soon.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
A lot of big lifts were registered in the full power and single event lifts. Big Josh Patterson pulled 785 and made it look easy.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
All of the lifters put up some nice numbers.  Special thanks to all who made this meet possible.  The APA will be returning to,,,,,,,,
Washington state in April so start gearing up.,,,,,,,,
