Chip Conrad's BodyTribe Fitness was the site of this years APA Iron Gladiators event and typical of,,,,,,,
all events hosted by BodyTribe this event was well organized and exciting. Special thanks to Chip,,,,,,,
and the crew he provided for putting on an outstanding event. Lifting quality was great in both the,,,,,,,
RAW categories and equipment assisted categories with the majority of lifters opting to lift in the,,,,,,,
RAW divisions. Lifting RAW Andy Laughlin took the overall best lifter award in the full power event.,,,,,,,
We had some outstanding ladies competing at this event. Bonnie Aerts continued to set several,,,,,,,
master records and gets better with every meet. Donna Cameron set a new California master record,,,,,,,
"in the squat, Alison Goule took the womens submaster class in the bench press event with a 130",,,,,,,
"lift, and after a 20 year layoff from competing Cara Huff came back to the platform to set a California",,,,,,,
master record with a RAW 190 lb. bench press! In the deadlift Maria Vermes at 104 bodyweight and,,,,,,,
"at 48 years of age set California, American, and World records in the deadlift with a smooth 255 lb.",,,,,,,
pull! Way to go Maria! Quite a battle took place in the RAW 220 lb. portion of the full power event,,,,,,,
"with Levi Chitwood taking the lead spot with a 1240 total, Eric Helms coming right behind for the 2nd",,,,,,,
"place slot with a 1200 pound total, and in 3rd was Matt Stumpf with an 1160 total. Another good",,,,,,,
battle took place in the master III. 275 lb. division of the bench press event with Bob Kehl emerging,,,,,,,
as the victor with a 430 lb. bench press at 69 years of age! In the 2nd place slot was Mike Bonifield,,,,,,,
"benching 355 at 66 years of age, and in 3rd place was 62 year old Phil Crawford who benched 295.",,,,,,,
All 3 gentlemen did some outstanding lifts for men between 60 and 70 years of age. The RAW,,,,,,,
242 class in the deadlift event was very close. Jeff Crow and Erik Holm were right on each other.,,,,,,,
Both lifters ended up with 565 deadlifts. Both men didn't make their 3rd attempts with Crow trying,,,,,,,
"575 pounds and Holm trying 600 and both tied on 2nd attempts with 565……….however, the 1st place",,,,,,,
spot in these situations goes to the lightest lifter and Crow was 3 pounds lighter than Holm so the,,,,,,,
1st place spot went to Jeff Crow.,,,,,,,
Best Lifter awards were the APA Executioner sculpture which is from a line of sculptures that are,,,,,,,
available only at APA meets.,,,,,,,
"Special thanks to all the lifters who showed and performed some excellent lifts, to Chip Conrad for providing",,,,,,,
"a great meet site and staff, our referee's and the spotters and loaders who did one heck of an outstanding job",,,,,,,
throughout the day. I look forward to the next APA in Sacramento which will be held in March.,,,,,,,
