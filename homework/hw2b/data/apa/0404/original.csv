"An event only turns out as good as the quality of those helping make it happen and we were fortunate enough to have Henry Nguyen, the owner of Millennium Gym & Fitness as the host of this event and his great staff as spotter/loaders. On the platform as referee’s were David Little, Joe Dalton, and Florida State Chairman Brian Highnote. These are the individuals that made this a well run event and they did a great job making this a memorable contest. Not to mention, a crowd of vocal and supportive spectators who cheered many of the lifters on to state records and personal best attempts. To each of these individuals I say thank you for all of your help and support. Although the turnout wasn’t huge the quality was great and several records were set. We look forward to holding another event in Largo soon. A special congratulations to those who set records today. I was amazed at the poundages going up from young teenagers all the way up to men in their sixties! Meet photo’s will soon be posted on the APA website.",,,,,,
