"The APA Battle of the Badasses Championships were held this past Saturday, August 3rd. The competition was incredible, sportsmanship fantastic, and the atmosphere was one of the best I have ever seen at a meet. Lifters from several states attended. Special thanks to the sponsors: Universal Chevrolet, Quality Towing, Chiropractic Partners, Wendell Auto Brakes, Spellman's Transmission, Mimi's Tanning Shak, Kai's Sports Bar & Grill, and National Discount Nutrition. The lifters were very happy the cash prizes that were distributed among the best lifters.   Unfortunately, we had 3 bomb-outs, we had several State, American and World records set.  The atmosphere was great and this added to the multitude of records set. Special thanks to Planet Fitness for providing a great meet site and special thanks to it's owner Kevin for setting up a DJ station and making announcements with music provided for each lifter.  Some highlights from the meet were 16 year old Becky Simpson totalling 813 for a WPA World record, Amy Vaughan's squat of total of 1097 winning best woman lifter with World records in the Squat, Deadlift, & total, Jeff McVicars total of 1860 at 193 lb. bodyweight, and freaky 560 bench which gave him Men's Best Lifter in the bench press, Travis Mash winning men's best lifter at bodyweight 220 and a total of 2040 for an American record in the total Julie Scanlons incredible 330 bench and 2 near lifts of 350 only to be red lighted for her butt coming off the bench to win Women's Best Lifter in the Bench Press. Spotting was fantastic with Strongman competitor Johnny Perry as center spotter as well as Capt. Kirk Karwoski spotting many of the lifters. I would like to commend the spotters/loaders and all meet staff for doing an excellent job and referee's John Demchak, Jerry Tancil, & Randy Smith. Unfortunately, I lost my complete list of helpers so I know I am forgetting a few names but thank you........especially to the beautiful ladies who helped me out at the scoretable (they did all the work). Stay tuned as the APA returns to Clayton, NC this December for yet another exciting event.",,,,,,,,
