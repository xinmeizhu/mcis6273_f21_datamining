* Those notated above had just finished their squats and a local school football coach was watching on facebook and disqualified his players,,,,,,,,,,,
from this powerlifting competition. The coach is not an APA member or official and football practice had not even begun yet! In other words,,,,,,,,,,,
"it was absolutely ""none of his business"". He did not have the guts to show up in person and do this and I had no idea he had done this until",,,,,,,,,,,
the bench press session was in progress.,,,,,,,,,,,
"So when does the ignorance end with football coaches? I feel bad for the students of the Harlingen, Texas School District if this is what they",,,,,,,,,,,
"have for leadership, and guidance.  The bottom line is this was summer vacation for these students, they were doing something constructive",,,,,,,,,,,
rather than get into trouble over vacation. Lifting weights makes better/stronger football players. Far more injuries occur in football practice,,,,,,,,,,,
than lifting weights.  Where was this morons mind????,,,,,,,,,,,
Considering the fact that these kids had already completed squats and were not disqualified by APA Officials who were the only persons who,,,,,,,,,,,
"had the right to call a disqualification - I put them in a ""Squat Only"" event so they could qualify for some of the records they had trained so hard",,,,,,,,,,,
"to earn.  Shame on the Harlingen, Texas School District for hiring an unqualified moron who butts in and interferes in other sports and organizations",,,,,,,,,,,
where he has no authority or legal right to do so. SAD!,,,,,,,,,,,
