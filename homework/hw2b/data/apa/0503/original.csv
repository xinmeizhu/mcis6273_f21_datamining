"Special thanks to Scot Long and the YMCA for providing an excellent venue and fantastic spotters and loaders. I would also like to thank Brent Smith and Pete Bouchard for judging the entire meet. Judging was strict, consistent, and fair. Lots of great lifts were performed and several records were set that will be noted on the APA website. The APA returns to Jackson on July 23. I look forward to seeing many of you there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
