The 2009 Tony Conyers Extravaganza was exciting as ever with Mr. Conyers competing this year and ,,,,,,,,,
lifting some amazing weights. Though we did not include his numbers in the mix for best lifter it was exciting  ,,,,,,,,,
to see that at 50 years old it can still be done. The next best thing was Leon Barry destorying 440 ,,,,,,,,,
pounds on the bench at 69 years old. Then we had youth getting it done to with World records being set ,,,,,,,,,
by Quentin Gomez with a 385 pound bench RAW. Some of the teens were very exciting also ,,,,,,,,,
making our future look very bright. The likes of Jorge Suarez getting his first equipped Best Lifter ,,,,,,,,,
"Award. Thanks also to all the judges Tom O donnell, Molly Yerakadu and Jason McElroy stepping in on",,,,,,,,,
