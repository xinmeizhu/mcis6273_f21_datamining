"A very special thanks to Morgan Mitchell who made this meet possible and did most of the setup work making this an excellent event, the gals at the",,,,,,,,
"scoretable who did an incredible job making things go smooth, the spotters and loaders who did an outstanding job, and the referee's who did a great",,,,,,,,
job throughout the day.  I would also like to thank Southampton Harley Davidson for providing us with an excellent venue.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
The event started off as an outdoor event under a tent. During the squats however it started raining very hard and we ended up moving the meet ,,,,,,,,
indoors. Some very outstanding lifting took place with several records being set.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Awards presented were very detailed sculptured awards for all places.  Lifters came from several states to participate and many rode their motorcycles,,,,,,,,
for several hours to compete in the event. Being the owner of a Harley Davidson Heritage Softail Deluxe I felt like a kid in a candy store walking around,,,,,,,,
the meet venue and ended up purchasing many goodies go figure….,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Once again, a very special thanks to all who made this a great event. Especially Morgan Mitchell who put countless hours into setting everything up and",,,,,,,,
making this a very special event. This will be an annual event so start getting ready now. ,,,,,,,,
