"Congratulations to all the lifter who competed in the 2004 APA Lone Star Open. A lot of great talent showed up from a wide range of ages. There were lifters from the age of 13 to 73 all competing to be the best in their division. From Galveston, Texas, 73 year old grandmother Nora Revilla pulled a world record deadlift of 210 pounds. Lifting with her that day was her son, Tony Galvez and the rest of Team Galvez members including Ernest Williams, Ricky Durant and Steven Childs and Nick Garza. Hitting a all time PR and setting a masters world record was Brian Kline with his over double body weight 400 pound bench press. Taking home the award of best lifter was 61 year old masters lifter Kit Price with his 1335 total in the 198's.",,,,,,,,,,
