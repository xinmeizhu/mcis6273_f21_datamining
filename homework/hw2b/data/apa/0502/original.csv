"Special thanks to Muscle Works Gym of Bradenton for providing a great meet site and equipment, and the spotters/loaders and referee's for putting in a long day. The judging was excelltent as was the spotting and loading. Not an error was made all day. Margaret Kirkland wowed everybody with some awesome master lifts while her teenage daughters also did some outstanding lifting and set some nice records. Cheryl McKenzie of Canada was quite impressive and did make an attempt at 401 in the squat. Had she succeeded it would have been the highest squat every preformed by a female Canadian lifter. Cynthia Daiello did some awesome lifting with a nice 140 bench press not wearing any gear such as bench shirt etc. Well done Cynthia! Jenn Rotsinger was impressive just missing a 170 bench press. Michael Walguarnery did a nice deep Junior record squat with 625 at 194 bodyweight. 58 year old Larry Russell smoked a 600 opener on the deadlift and just missed 670. Speaking of Master lifters, Tom O'Donnell played things conservative and passed all his 3rd attempts. He ended up with with a 685 squat and 665 deadlift at 52 years of age. I especially enjoy watching Tom compete as I remember when he first started training at 38 years of age. I have watched him progress over the years and turn into one of the best master lifters in the world. But Rosenfield continues to be impressive through the decades. Now 73 years old Burt put up a 310 lb. Bench press. John Murrell took best lifter in the full power and the push-pull event. John just missed a 740 squat on depth being just a hair too high. Mike Hummel amazed everybody with a 565 bench press and an attempt at 600 with a prosthetic arm from the elbow down. It was a great day full of great lifts. Several could not attend as they were getting ready for the WPA World Championships in a few weeks but those that were able to attend put on a great show. The APA will return to Bradenton in November.",,,,,,,
