"David Brown, Lisa Valentine, Mike and Christi Witmer for their continue support of our sport and all the time and effort they put into",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the sport.  Most of the lifters had a great attitude and were very supportive of each other.  A couple of people had a problem with ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the rule about not using foul language but that’s the breaks. One thing people complain most about is public perception and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
acceptance of the sport and under the same breath set a poor example as adults and sportsman in front of the children viewing an,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
event.  Those people are obviously used to lifting in a circus act and can return to the circus.  Lifting quality was great. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48 year old Tony Conyers squatted a huge 760 at 162 lbs. bodyweight!  The man gets better with age. James Jacobs hit a huge,,,,,,,,, Jacobs,hit,a,nice,,,
850 squat but missed all 3 620 bench press attempts and bombed out. As a master lifter John Davis hit a nice 810 squat and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ended with a 1990 total. The oldest lifter in the event was Bill Remley at 76 years of age.  Bill had been away from competition for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
quite awhile and made a nice comback.  Some of the raw lifts were awesome to watch.  John Burkhead of Florida and Scott,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kuzma of Virginia went at it in the Master I. 275 RAW class with Burkhead ending up with a 515 bench and Kuzma ending up with,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
500.  Both men were quite impressive to watch and both are great sportsmen. Eric Talmant put in a 1320 total and pulled a 580,,,,,Eric Talmant pulled 580 RAW weighing 163.5 and,,,,,,,,,,
ended up with a 1320 total to win the RAW Best Lifter award.  Special thanks to all who put in a long day and a lot of effot to make,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this a memorable event.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
