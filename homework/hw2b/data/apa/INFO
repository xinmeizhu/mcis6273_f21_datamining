Divisions are as follows:

- Raw: knee wraps are allowed.
- Standard Gear: Single-ply for Squat and Deadlift, but allowed Double-ply for Bench (thus Multi-ply).
                 Beginning in 2019, they disallowed Double-ply in this category.
                 So from 2019 onward, it can count as Single-ply.
- Unlimited Gear: Multi-ply.
