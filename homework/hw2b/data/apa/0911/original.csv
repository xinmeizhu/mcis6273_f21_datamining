"A very special thanks to Rodney Wood, all the referee's, spotters, loaders, table staff, and Christian Life Center for an excellent event",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and venue.  This years Nationals went very smooth and some awesome lifting took place. Meet photos are now posted on the APA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
website www.apa-wpa.com  We could not have asked for a better venue or staff for this years event. The majority of the lifters chose,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to lift RAW and several new records were set at this event.  Congrats to all on some outstanding lifting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
