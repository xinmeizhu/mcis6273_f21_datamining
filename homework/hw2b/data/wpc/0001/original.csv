2000 WPC/AWPC WORLD POWERLIFTING CHAMPIONSHIPS,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
RESULTS LISTED AT BOTTOM OF ARTICLE,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"The 2000 WPC/AWPC World Championships took place November 9-19 in Las Vegas, Nevada USA. With approximately 625 entries it was the largest most ambitious undertaking in Powerlifting history. WPC President Ernie Frantz is to be commended for his yearlong preparation. He even designed a new platform, which combined all three lifts in an easily changed combination of hydraulic equipment in order to give the audience maximum viewing and the lifters maximum safety. Of course, Ernie put together a top-notch team to assist him, also heading that team was the remarkable Amy Jackson, WPC/APF Secretary who handles all situations with humor, competence and wisdom. Handling the job of WPC Overseer was Voytek Bretyn who was everyplace at one time, it seemed Jim Rouse did an outstanding job as Technical Officer, coordinating 11 days of lifting in extraordinary fashion.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"However, the hardest job of all was the one performed by the platform crew Linzee’s Loaders. Ernie had the wisdom and foresight to import Phil Lindsey and his crew from England for these Championships. This group of men and women handled loading, spotting and table expediting in a manner rarely seen. They were prompt and swift and always smiling. Most importantly this skilled group saved several lifters from serious injury. I got to do the announcing and scoring during most of the 11 days but I would like to thank the people who helped me out when I needed a break or when I had to lift. They are: Bill Nichols, Yuris Sterns (Australia), Linda and Mike Higgins, Bob Spaulding, Gary Baum, and special thanks to Mary Jane Capehart who kept me grounded and sane the entire time she was there.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"In addition, a special thanks goes out to all the referee’s and officials who handled the judging and weigh ins like clockwork.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"The meet was held at the Plaza Hotel. The meet site and the warm-up area were spacious and stocked with the best equipment available. As I said, the newly designed hydraulic monolift and stage were a fantastic lifting platform. This freed up 3 monolifts for the warm up area. You should know that Ernie, Voytek, and Jim Rouse transported most of the equipment from Illinois themselves. Special thanks to Huge Iron Gym, Tony Pastorello and Kieran Kidder for the remainder of the equipment.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Day One – AWPC Junior, Teenage, Submaster",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"In the teen division we saw some really outstanding lifting. Outstanding lifter in this division was 17 year old 75 kg. Lifter Mark Mendoza, son of World Champion Bench Presser Israel Mendoza. The apple certainly didn’t fall far from the tree this time! Mark set a world record with every lift going 10 for 11 for the day. Other outstanding lifters included Tyson Orwoll USA, and especially Steve Wagner USA. Don’t get me wrong – it’s inspiring to see so many strong teens as they are the future of Powerlifting.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"In the Jr Division there were 2 female competitors. Outstanding lifter Alissa Weinberg set several world records. However, not to be ignored was former National Gymnastics Champion Jackie Licata, who also set world records.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
In the Men’s division it was a contest between the USA and Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijan’s won the classes 3 to 2 with some very impressive lifting.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
The Submaster division also saw some great lifting. The one’s that stand out here were Leo Welch and Randy White with Mike Ferrantelli taking home the Outstanding Lifter honors.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Day 2 Master Men and Women,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"This division is always a large one. The Master lifters come out to lift and to have a good time and they did. There were competitors from the USA, Wales, and Great Britain. Everyone did well. In the 40-44 60 kg. Class Danny Harris USA got a nice 117.5 WR deadlift that he’s been looking for a long time. The 75kg. Class saw a WR bench press for Manuel Rivera USA. In the 82.5 Bob Lynch USA made a beautiful 4th attempt DL of 275 for a new WR. 125’r Mike Frizzell USA got himself a new WR bench press with 230. In 45-49 67.5 kg. Martin Heindl Austria set a new WR with every lift going only 5 for 9. 75 kg. Lifter Craig Hanson got a WR with an easy 175 kg. squat. 82.5 kg. Welcomed National and World Champions and record holder Rudy Ruettiger USA . While he didn’t have the meet he wanted he was only out totaled by the heavyweights. 100 kg. World Champion Dick Zenzen USA returned to the competitive platform with an amazing performance. After suffering a near fatal accident two weeks before the 1999 Worlds he came back with a near perfect meet. Welcome home, Dick.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
In 50-54 75 kg. Charles Wodraska set WR’s in the squat and total on his way to his World Championships. 100 kg. lifter Dave Damiano Sr. USA set WR’s in all three lifts and total for a beautiful win.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"The 55-59 group 82.5’s had some good competition between 2 World Champions Eddie Angstrom USA and Les Cramer USA. While Les got WR’s in the squat Eddie stayed ahead by 5 kg. to take the win after both men missed their final DL’s. Michael Brown (Wales) in the 125’s managed a WR 230 DL. After being off the competition platform after knee surgery and 2 years off. 140 kg. Charles Clonce USA is always smiling and strong. He added another World Championship to his already well stocked trophy collection with WR’s in the squat, deadlift, and total.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"65 year old 100 kg. lifter Tony Conkle USA was very pleased with his gold medal. Why not?  He rewrote the record books in his class. 77 year old John Upton USA was the oldest competitor of the entire 9 days. He set WR’s in the DL and Total. That is what is great about powerlifting, you never have to quit!",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"But the greatest lifting of this day was done by 60 kg. Nori Kawasaki age 72. Nori originally started lifting to help with a very bad leg injury. Soon after he got rid of the crutches and has been setting the standard ever since. With WR’s in the BP, DL and Total he walked away with Outstanding lifter honors.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"The Master Women were outstanding. 52 kg. 43 year old Coral Quinell Australia easily walked away with outstanding lifter honors. But that was just the beginning. 82.5 Terri Ann Black won her first World Championships with a new WR squat. 48 year old 90 kg. “Lady in Red” Wilma Cadavona USA laughed her way to her first World Championships, also setting WR’s along the way. 52 year old diminutive 48 kg. Chris Brigham USA had some nice WR’s in her win also. 70 year old Betty Tenorio USA was poetry in motion. I know she didn’t have the meet she wanted but she still set a WR in the DL.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Day 3 – Open Women & Men,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"This was a lightly contested day but certainly not without great lifting. 60 kg. Dionne Wessels USA returned to the competitive platform after a 2 year absence with spectacular Outstanding Lifter Award and WR’s in the Squat, DL, and Total. The men’s open division saw some outstanding performances. Dan Spitale USA took the 90 kg. including a beautiful 320 kg. squat. 100 kg. Alex Zweig USA is rarely thrilled with his platform performance. But he’s always strong enough to win the big ones. He took another World Championship handily. In the 110’s it was great to see T.C. Roesch USA return to competition after several years absence with his 787.5 winning total. Outstanding Lifter was returning World Champion Bryan Figola USA. Lifting with an injury which really hampered his meet preparation, he turned in an award winning total.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
4 – Police & Fire,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"We had a lot of great lifting here. 82.5 Rudy Ruettiger competed for a second time in a week holding off Chicago Police Officer Steve Gawlik by 10 kg.  90 kg.’s saw a clash of titans. Legendary Jim Rouse USA 59 years old and Technical Officer for the entire meet was slightly off his game here. Are you surprised? He wound up in 2nd to Lombard, IL Police Officer John Latronica. This is certainly not to take anything away from John who’s 697.5 total was the highest of this division and won him the Best Lifter. Big Bill Nichols USA was going to use this day as a warmup for later in the week. He was unable to satisfy the referees in the squat and this probably affected his performance. But more on that later.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Day 5 – Bench Press AWBC & WBC,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Today was as close to a marathon as could be. We had almost 200 lifters with a total of 12 flights throughout the day. The a.m. session concluded the AWPC portion of the meet. There were a huge number of WR’s broken. The Azerbaijan’s were impressive as usual. But that was no easy feat.  Equally strong were the South Africans and of course, the Americans. The Austrian’s were well represented in both the Men’s and Women’s divisions as well.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"The same was true in the 8 flights contested in the afternoon session which began the WPC portion of the World Championships. The German’s came on strong, along with the Brits and Austrians. The Fins, Americans and South Africans had some outstanding performances. And the French, with a very small team were very strong as usual. Open BL Bill Carpenter USA had a truly outstanding 277.5 BP in the 100 kg. class.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Day 6 – Men & Women WPC Teen & Jr.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Another outstanding day for the Americans, Brits, South Africans and Israelis. Teen lifter Priscilla Giddings USA, Rosie Yanikyan Canada, and Stan DuPlessis South Africa had really great performances, as did Patrick Sparks USA.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
The Junior division was totally impressive. 90 kg. Mark Fanone who competes Olympic and Power had a great 832.5 total. 100 kg. Bernhard Schwab Austria blew away his competition with 850 kg.  In the 110’s Jose Garcia USA wasn’t happy with his 877.5 total but still blew away his competition by close to 250 kg. The 125’s were taken by Finland’s Mikka Hamalainen by 85 kg. with a 980 total. The 140’s went to Vugar Namazov of Azerbaijan.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Day 7- Master Men and Sub Master Women,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"The 67.5 Master men had a few outstanding showings. Martin Heindl of Austria went 9 for 9 for his gold medal. 62 year old Fred Glass got himself a WR DL. But 74 year old Frank Richey won overall Master BL with a 447.5 WR Total setting WR’s in all three lifts. The Submaster women were equally impressive. But the most impressive was BL South African Air Force Lt. Col. Lizzie Allworth with the highest total of the day, 457.5 kg.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"The p.m. session had the Master women. 44 kg Nadine Baker USA carried home BL honors with her 280 total. Linda Higgins USA won the 50-54 52 kg. gold after knee surgery this past year. 60 kg 40-44 Wendy Greig Canada had a 9 for 9 day. 82.5 70 year old Arline Ramsrud USA set WR’s in all three lifts and total for her gold medal. 42 year old 90 kg. lifter Mona Overstreet USA had a concussion at Nationals but healed well for a terrific 8 for 9 410 total. Also 90 kg 52 year old Maris Anne Sternberg returned to competition after 2 years of health issues and surgeries with a 402.5 8 for 9 performance, winning her 21st World Championship. Leslie Miller won the Supers in that age group with a new DL WR.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"The Men’s Submaster had some good competition, 75 kg Vince Graham Canada won BL Light with his 675 kg total. Brent Tracey USA took the BL Heavy with an 820 total in the 90 kg’s. 100 kg Eric Maroscher USA won his class easily also. The 110’s had 6 competitors but when the chalk settled it was Jean Marc Chenin France with the gold. Brothers Agnar and Axel Adalsteinsson USA won the 125’s and 140’s respectively.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Day 8 – Master Men,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"This part of the competition had impressive lifting and some surprises. In the 75 k class gold medals went to Gary Reichert USA 40 year old. 49 year old Avitar Jawanda Great Britain, 51 year old Gordon Olsen USA, 58 year old Herb Glossbrenner USA, 62 year old Richard Flores USA and 76 year old Pierre Pothee France.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
A big surprise in the 82.5’s was the bomb out of Robyn Brown Great Britain. Robyn has been a fixture in Powerlifting for as long as I can remember. He just couldn’t please the judges. Equally impressive was 61 year old Ian Morris’ South Africa victory. It was good to see Bill Ramsrud USA on the platform also.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"In the 90’s Ken Richardson USA (41) pulled ahead of a strong field winning his class by 10 k over Austria’s Heinz Buhl. Paul Latter Great Britain (48) was victorious over a strong field beating 45 year old Russell Dell USA. It was a USA win in 50-54 with Len Mintus’ 670 to Robert Jordan’s Great Britain 650. The 55-59’s saw Jim Rouse lifting a second time this week. Unfortunately, I think the stress of being head Technical Officer and the fact that Jim’s mighty BP failed him took their toll. He came close at sub total with only 2.5k separating him and Henri Marion France. Henri was able to get ahead in the DL and left with the win. 63 year old LB Baker added another World Championship to his belt.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
The 100’s had some good competition. The 40-44 were won by George Pessel USA with Christian Mikysek Austria taking silver and Bob Kelly USA settling for the bronze. The 50-54’s were won easily by Alan Luker Great Britain by a margin of 85 kg. 63 year old Ron Damon came to the meet with an ear infection which affected his balance but he still totaled well. 65 year old Bob Spaulding has been seeking a World Championship for a long time and he finally got it.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
The 110’s were strong in all age groups but the stongest over all the age groups was 54 year old lifting legend Bill West Great Britain. He’s as strong as ever. His 885 total won him BL Heavy honors easily.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"The 125’s 40-44 were and incredibly close race. Lee Marshall Great Britain and Dino Toci Australia were in a battle right from the beginning. Lee had the bigger squat but Dino cam back with a bigger bench. Dino was actually ahead by 10 k at subtotal but had trouble hanging on to a 345 DL for the win. This allowed Lee Marshall, with his 3 for 3 deadlifts tie the score. Since Lee was the lighter lifter he managed the win. 48 year old John Florio USA is Back. It was never close and John blew his competition out of the water.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
In the 140’s 40-44 another close one developed. Matt Israelson USA looked like he was on line for a gold with a 32.5k lead after the squat over Pekka Rantenen Finland. Pekka closed the gap in the BP to 5 k at subtotal and finished the job in the DL claiming 1st place.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
The Super’s had some real strength across the age groups. 40 year old Hannie Smith South Africa posted a fine total for his win. George Brink demolished his competition in the 50-54’s by 65 k. I was thrilled to see big Phil Niemandt South Africa back on the platform. A few years ago Phil became the first South African to ever bench 600 and he did it as a Master. He hasn’t competed in a while because of personal and health problems but he’s back now and will soon be back to his former self.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Day 9 – Women’s Open & Light Weight Men,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"The Women’s 48 k class was a real surprise. Lynne Barlow, usually strong and consistent had a balance problem which kept her from getting a squat passed. This opened it up for a British sweep for Julie Schroeder (gold) and Leslie Watson (silver) Karen Wilcox Great Britain had the 52 kg class to herself but turned in a very creditable 300 total. The 56’s turned out to be a battle between two good friends. Due to her bomb out at USA Nationals in the 60 kg’s Amy Weisberg USA wound up cutting weight and becoming an alternate in the 56’s. This put her against National Champion Nance Avigliano USA. When the chalk dust settled Amy had posted a whopping 500 total giving her the win and BL Light. There would be another surprise this day for National Champion Melanie Diamond. Unable to get a squat passed she bombed out of the competition. This gave Vicki Huyers South Africa the gold and Vanessa Ware USA the silver. The 67.5 class saw an old rivalry between two Powerlifting divas Nancy Dangerfield USA and Mariah Liggett USA. While Nancy is a super deadlifter, it wasn’t enough that day to overcome Mariah. With an awesome 545 total with a 4th attempt squat of 240, Mariah was so far ahead at subtotal time that Nancy just couldn’t catch up. So Mariah added another World title and Best Lifter trophy to her collection. 75 k Julie Scanlon USA blasted Joyce Tacktill by 80 k. Joyce certainly had a good total but against Julie she had to settle for silver this year.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"The 82.5’s were taken by Jeannette Miller Great Britain who posted the biggest total of the meet. Unfortunately, Christine Rainer Austria was never in this flight finishing 130 k behind. Tarja Rantanen Finland took the 90’s unopposed. Her 535 total was after having lifted in the BP competition. She’s very strong and very nice. I expect if she continues in the sport she will post huge numbers.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"One of the worst sights in powerlifting is seeing a fellow lifter go down under a bar. As South African Mirinda Van Dyk won the gold in the Unlimited class with championship lifts it was Dorothy Shaw (Great Britain) on everyone’s mind. Dorothy Shaw is the most powerful woman in the sport. Not only would she have won this meet she was poised to blow the all-time women’s records to smithereens. Taking a 286k WR squat on a third attempt (the all-time overall record squat) she lost her balance at the bottom and fell forward. Because of her particular squat style she was unable to let go of the bar and fell forward on her knees, the bar threatening to break her in half, literally. The spotters truly saved her life, catching the bar in mid air. Sadly, the damage was done. Both of her patellas and tendons were shattered.  She was rushed to the hospital and made as comfortable as possible. Dorothy was flown home to major double surgery. To make it worse, her daughter and her father watched from the audience while the terrible scene unfolded. A collection was taken to help her out. If she is never able to lift again, and sadly, it looks that way, the world will be deprived of one of the greats.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"The men’s lightweight began the afternoon session. The perennial champion Ernesto Milian returned again this year for another outstanding championship performance. The 60 k’s turned into pretty much of a rout for Germany’s Reno Karkuschke who started out well ahead of Steven Grey Great Briain and never looked back. 67.5 US National Champion Tim Judge was ready for this meet. What he wasn’t ready for was Sakari Selkainaho of Finland who finished 105 k ahead for the gold. Tim had to be content with the silver with Steve Cook of Wales finishing 60 k behind him. The 75 k’s were filled with strong lifters. Any of these totals were enough to win a World Championship. This however, was not a regular meet. Angelo Berardinelli USA came to compete and so did Jarmo Laine Finland came to be the spoiler. Jarmo led after the squats when Angelo was only able to pass his opener. Angelo’s superior benching put him out in front at subtotal.  After that Jarmo tried to catch him coming within 5 k but Angelo was just too strong for him. Angelo took the gold by 5 k and a 227.5 BP WR with Jarmo taking home the silver and David Mannering of Great Britain got the bronze. In addition, Angelo finished well ahead in the race for BL Light.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Day 10 – Open Men 82.5-110,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"I’ve known Neville Primich South Africa since he was a teenager. I must say I’ve never seen him falter. It looked like he was going to take this large class again this year. He was so far ahead after the squat even with Arnold Coleman USA and Joe Dougherty USA in the class, that it really seemed like a “gimme”. What a shock as he fell further and further behind trying to finish a BP. And then the worst happened, he bombed. With defending champion Neville Primich out of the picture the class opened wide. This really paid off for Arnold Coleman USA and Joe Dougherty USA. Sports fans, never doubt that meet savvy really pays off. Joe Dougherty choose his attempts carefully and conservatively, which enabled him to go 9 for 9. Arnold Coleman was actually 5 k ahead at subtotal time thanks to his bench. He even had a successful 4th attempt at 250. Call it ego, bad coaching, or whatever, instead of calling for what he needed to win, he chose to go for a world record DL or 306.5. He couldn’t complete it twice and it cost him the gold medal by 2.5 kg. Eric Athias finished the medals with the bronze.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Just as this battle ended, enter Jesse Kellum USA in the 90 kg. Jesse got married in July and didn’t compete at the US Nationals. Thanks to lifters changing classes, Jesse was allowed to compete in the 90’s as an alternate. Even on a bad day he was able to cream the competition by 52.5 k. Martin Donovan Great Britain took the silver and Bronson Brown South Africa won the bronze in one of the largest classes in the meet.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
The 100’s and 110’s ere the biggest classes in the meet with 10 lifters each. The 100’s saw defending champion Matt Zweng finish with the bronze amidst rumors of retirement. We’ll have to wait and see if that’s the case. The silver went home with Harrold Selsam Germany. And Gerhard Depner Austria after almost bombing tin the squat won the gold by 5k.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
The 110‘s was taken fairly easily by Paul Urchick USA who was well ahead of his competition at subtotal time with new meet PR’s in both the squat and the BP. At that point Michael Weiler Austria and Dennis Muratori USA were tied. Paul made us all shudder when he missed his opening DL. He pulled it on the second attempt but missed his third. Pulling only one DL he still finished first which left Dennie and Michael in a battle for the silver medal. Dennis Muratori has been a top competitor for many years and by calling his deadlifts carefully he edged Michael Weiler out by 5 k to take the silver.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Day 11 – The heavy Weights,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Bill Nichols USA was hoping to become World Champion once again. Unfortunately, injury and conservatism combined to deny him that dream. Ano Turtiainen Finland had something to say about that, also. Bill injured a bicep 2 weeks before the meet. He also chose to lower his opening squat considerably after his difficulties in the Police & Fire division. Finishing ahead after squats, a cervical disc injury and the bicep kept him from getting the big bench he needed. Still in the running at subtotal time Ano’s superiority in the DL with a 390 WR gave him the win easily. Steve Wiseman of Canada finished 20k back for the bronze.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
The top 3 140’s each came in strong in each of their specialties. Allan Meehan Canada was in the lead over Craig Gallo USA and Andy Bolton Great Britain. After the squats he then took a WR 4th attempt at 458.5 which he made in fine fashion. Craig Gallo eked out a better bench by 2.5 k to subtotal 5k behind Meehan with Andy Bolton in 3rd by 20k.  Andy Bolton Great Britain is an incredible deadlifter pulling a 407.5 WR leaving the others behind for a 1072.5 winning total. As the dust cleared Craig took the silver with Allan settling for the bronze.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"And finally, the competition entered the stratosphere with the Supers as Brent Mikesell and Garry Frank went head to head. Brent finished with a beautiful 455 squat after having to take his opener twice. Behind by 27.5k Garry took over in the bench. Both men missed their 2nd and 3rd benches. But Garry’s superiority in the bench gave him the subtotal led of 67.5k and he never looked back. Pulling a massive 397.5 DL, Garry Frank USA became the first man in history to total 1120 making him the strongest man in the world, hand down. It was a fitting historical end to an historical meet for this gracious winner and truly gentle giant taking home a rare super heavy weight Champion of Champions trophy.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"The WPC has always been able to claim the strongest lifters in the world and Garry Frank proved it handily, surpassing Ed Coan’s long standing record. The team trophy went to the USA with 2nd place going to Great Britain.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Following the meet there was a pizza and beer party where participants had a chance to view videos of previous WPO Competitions and a video about Capetown, South Africa which will host the 2001 WPC Worlds. The AWPC Worlds will be held in Dallas, Texas. It was great to catch up with old friends and meet new ones. I’ve always said each World meet is fantastic but each one is different. This one was no disappointment. Ernie Frantz put on a World Class meet in a world class venue setting. Powerlifting history along the way. I pray that I haven’t forgotten to thank anyone involved. If I have I sincerely apologize. Please know that I, even more, Ernie are eternally grateful. Congratulations to all the new World Champions and thank you Ernie.",,,,,,,,
