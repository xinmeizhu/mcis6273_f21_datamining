2003 USPF Texas Cup Championships

JPS' MEET REPORT:

"First off, let me say that I was greatly pleased by the feedback I received about the judging: it was strict and consistent. My sincere thanks to Joe Dalton, Mike Sheffler, Sheldon, and all the other USPF judges who helped out!"


It turned out to be fairly small meet which was perfect since this was only the 2nd event that Tim and I had ever put on and we only used a single platform. 53 lifters turned up with several from out of state. Among the more notable contestants:


"Local legend Gene Bell guest lifted as a 220 lber and posted EASY lifts of 733-551-672=1956. He's definitely headed for the Cup in June. Gene is a very gracious gentleman and didn’t push himself at all today: still very formidable, even at age 47."


"308 lb CHILD PRODIGY (bwahaha) Josh Bryant flew in from California with his dad and didn’t need to qualify for the Cup, having already done so last June, just wanted to have a go at some “un-equipped” lifting PRs. Hit an EZ 601 bench, looked good for at least 20 lbs more, but misgrooved his 611 and missed it at the top. He’s very explosive on the bottom, that’s for sure… He and his dad are credits to the sport. VERY NICE PEOPLE!"


"The INCOMPARABLE Ed Coan brought quite an impressive crew from Quads Gym and since this was his first meet in nearly a year and a half since a devastating knee injury, lifted extremely conservatively. Like Josh, he too went “un-equipped”:"


"Ed toyed with his 760 squat opener but twinged his right upper thigh slightly on 804 and bailed; he didn’t want to take any chances on a “real” injury so passed on any further squat attempts. Ed then posted a token 501 BP, finally toyed with laughably EZ 705 DL. Total= 1967 and another ticket to the Mountaineer Cup series in June 2004."


"One of Ed’s proteges was 350 lb Brian Schoonveld, a pro strongman competitor and one of the best in that discipline. This was to be Brian’s first pling meet and he followed Ed’s advice enroute to a fantastic 2055 total with lifts that were so far below his max that they should have been warm-ups:"


"Brian popped up 744 like it weighed 135 and then went on to a 584 bench that easily had about another 50 lbs left over. He passed his 3rd. Deads are his weakness and all he pulled was a measly, albeit EZ 727. This guy has at least a 2200 in him, possibly as early as June at the Mountaineer Cup which is where he’s headed next summer…"


"Some of the faces seen in the crowd in a largely supportive role: the kind-hearted and soft-spoken 275 lb future legend Tony Cardella; the mighty gremlin Wade Hooper; my personal guest, mentor and Eddy Coan’s future nemesis should he ever come out of retirement: James Cash; USPF Prez David Jeffrey; superwoman Jill Mills; and last but not least: the MAGNANIMOUS Nick Busick."


"Let me tell you a little bit about Nick: Here is a guy who flew half-way across the country to lift in the qualifier for his own Mountaineer Cup, had a bit of bad luck in the squat (the power was there but not the whites), and he’s practically consoling ME because I feel like shit after the referee’s call on his 3rd, which was not exactly popular, by the way…"


"No tantrums, no belt-throwing, no cursing, no looking for excuses, just a simple smile and a gracious acknowledgment that when it’s the ref’s decision, that’s just the way it HAS TO BE."


Nick is a true warrior and a true gentleman. He even spent some time patiently helping out with the announcing. I cannot say enough good things about this kind and generous man.


"My heartfelt thanks also go out to Tim Bruner who did 90% of the work putting together this meet and busted his ass welding the squat racks, and chalk trays and investing so many thousands of dollars for top notch inventory. Tim is a goofball but has his heart and head in the right place when it comes to the sport he loves. Without Tim Bruner there would be NO USPF in Texas, that’s for damn sure…"
